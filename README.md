# JWTApplication
This is a basic application built using Django-REST Framework. Here when a user is authenticated, he is provided a token (i.e. JSON Web Token) by the Authentication Server, with the help of which he is able to make an API Call to our Application. Our Application verifies the token and then only user gets access to API data.
